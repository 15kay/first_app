# 🚍 Transport Booking System
This project is a simple transport booking system built with Flutter that allows students to book seats for a bus ride. It connects to a backend API to handle seat booking and manages student data. The goal is to reduce fuel consumption by ensuring only the required number of seats are booked.

# 🚀 Features
Student Seat Booking: Students can book seats for the bus ride by entering their names.
API Integration: Flutter app connects to a backend API to store and manage bookings.
Bus Capacity Management: Helps transportation organizers plan routes based on the number of students.
# 📱 Tech Stack
Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
Backend: Python Django (or C# ASP.NET)
API Communication: HTTP requests (using http package in Flutter)
Database: SQLite (for local testing) / PostgreSQL (for production)
## 🔧 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Before running the app, you need to set up the following:

Flutter: Install Flutter on your system. Follow the official Flutter installation guide.
Android Studio/Visual Studio Code: Install an IDE with Flutter plugin.
Backend API: You will need a working API to handle seat bookings. The API can be created using Python Django or C# ASP.NET.
### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transport-booking-system.git
cd transport-booking-system
### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
Install Flutter dependencies by running:
sh
Copy
Edit
flutter pub get
### 4️⃣ Run the App
To run the app on an Android emulator or device:
sh
Copy
Edit
flutter run
# 🔧 Backend API Setup (Optional)
If you're setting up the backend API on your own, follow these steps:

Python Django API Example
Install Django and Django REST framework:
sh
### Copy Edit
pip install django djangorestframework
Create a new Django project and app:
sh
### Copy Edit
django-admin startproject transport_api
cd transport_api
django-admin startapp bookings
Set up API endpoints for booking seats (you can create a POST endpoint to handle the booking request from the Flutter app).

#### Update the database models to include a Booking model with fields like student_name, seat_number, etc.

## 🛠 Usage
Book a Seat: Enter your name in the provided text field and click on the "Book Seat" button. This will send a request to the backend API to store the booking.
View Bookings: If you’ve set up a backend to store bookings, you can fetch and display all bookings in the app.
